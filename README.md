Admin, Student Login, and Staff Login. Administrators efficiently handle user accounts, while
students access personalized tools for tracking attendance, results, and support services. The
Staff Login module enables mentors to monitor student performance and manage attendance,
fostering collaboration. The dynamic Sports and Events module showcases achievements and
upcoming events, enhancing community spirit. In summary, this system optimizes administrative
processes and cultivates a holistic, engaging sports education environment for both students and
staff.
